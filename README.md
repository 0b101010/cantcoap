========

CoAP implementation that focuses on simplicity by offering a minimal set of functions and straightforward interface.

This is a CoAP implementation with a focus on simplicity. The library only provides PDU construction and de-construction.
The user is expected to deal with retransmissions, timeouts, and message ID matching themselves. This isn’t as arduous as it sounds and makes a lot more sense on a constrained device.
Imagine for example a simple microcontroller sensor that only reports readings once every 15 minutes, and only sends a few packets each time. Do you really need a complicated framework to deal with acknowledgements and re-transmissions?

Since CoAP recommends you only send one packet at at time, this means you only need to keep track of one on-going transaction at a time. I think you’re capable of doing the retransmission logic in a few lines of code.

Furthermore, the timers and interrupt processes between different embedded processor architectures, vary quite a bit. So it often makes sense to write the packet sending processes yourself.

Finally, you might be sending the packets over odd transport bearers such as a SMS or a simple radio bearer. In which case, it’s easiest to deal with buffers. If I built retransmission handlers, they’d all be UDP/IP specific and would bloat the code.
